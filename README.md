# Deep-Learning-HW4
The repository is for DL HW4, object detection on VOC2007.

The model we use is YOLOv5. 

The code is modified by the following link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git.
If the code is not valid, please let me know. 
I will cancel the repository.

Preprocessing of VOC2007 can be implemented by the files of the folder "preprocessing".
If you would like to train YOLOv5, you can simply python train.py.
